**CCI:U** stands for _"Cloud-Computing Initiative for Universities"_. This project has been started by NexR, a cloud-computing company (http://nexr.co.kr), as a member of [Consortium of Cloud Computing Research of Korea](http://cccr.or.kr/).

The objective of this project is to build a developer community including students and professors who study distributed systems and algorithms as well as corporation members who want to test a large-scale computing infrastructure. A similar approach has been done already by Google and IBM, in the name of ["ACCI"](http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2007/10/let-thousand-servers-bloom.html) in US, but the system was not completely public and locally limited. We are going to leap over these limitations by starting this project to make it available to more universities around the world. If you want to access the course materials developed by the universities that joined the ACCI pilot program, see [Google Code University](http://code.google.com/intl/ko/edu/parallel/index.html).

**CCI:U Open Course Labs** is a Django-based web application that interfaces cloud-computing infrastructure such as Amazon EC2 and NexR icube cloud. More backends may be added later, of course, by us or you. Like the name, it provides the access to cloud infra in the form of "course labs" where course staffs in academy can manage the allocated computing resources and assignments easily. Course labs can be used as course homepages also.

### Open Source ###
This open-source projects contains the bleeding edge version we actually use and develop. All development (from commit logs to every user-interface string) is done in English to promote participation by abroad developers. From just chopping out a snippet from this project to sending great patches, all kinds of participation is welcome.

### Open Service ###
We provide a small-sized cluster for free after inspecting requests from universities. A university can use our proprietary cloud platform called icube cloud located in South Korea via CCI:U Open Course Labs, or may choose Amazon EC2 platform that is nearest to you in the same manner.<br />(**Note:** To use EC2, you have to pay yourself and provide your access/secret key to the service.)

The actual service will become available soon and be linked here.
